# Bus Info (iOS)

## Introduction

This is the iOS companion app for my [Bus Info](https://github.com/Jacob-Walton/buses-info) project. It's a simple app that displays bus information for Runshaw College, including a map of the bus stops.

## Warnings

- This app is not intended for any kind of production use as it stands, this is one of my first iOS projects and it WILL have bugs. If you find any, please report them on the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/Jacob-Walton/buses-info_ios/issues).
- The uptime for my backend server is not guarantted to be 100%. If the server is down, the app will not work.
- This app is currently not available on the App Store. A testflight version will be coming soon, but for now you will need to build the app yourself.
- The app is currently only available for iOS 17.6 and above.
